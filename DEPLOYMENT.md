# NOVA production deployment

The production frontend is a Vite application deployed to Vercel from the repository root, and the Express API in `server/` is deployed to Render. The frontend's SPA rewrite is configured in `vercel.json`; `server/Dockerfile` provides the API container. Do not create another service if the existing Vercel and Render services are already connected to this repository.

## Required configuration

Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env` and set:

- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `HOST=0.0.0.0` and `PORT=4000` (or the values supplied by the runtime)
- `DATABASE_URL` to the production PostgreSQL connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` to a unique random value of at least 32 characters, stored only in the deployment secret manager
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`, `COOKIE_NAME`, and `COOKIE_SAME_SITE`; the production default is `none` for the cross-site Vercel/Render deployment, and secure cookies require HTTPS. Use `lax` or `strict` only when the web and API are same-site.
- `CORS_ORIGIN` to one or more exact HTTPS web origins separated by commas; wildcards are rejected in production
- `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`, `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`, and `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`

The frontend API URL is `https://nova-social-platform-api.onrender.com` by default. Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to that exact origin in Vercel's project environment settings for production builds; the variable is optional for the current frontend source, which falls back to the same production API URL and does not fall back to localhost. The root `.env.example` contains only the safe, blank variable name.

## Vercel

Use the existing Vercel project and configure it to deploy the repository's `main` branch with the repository root as the project root. Vite's defaults use `npm ci`, `npm run build`, and `dist`; `vercel.json` rewrites browser routes to `index.html` so refreshes on client-side routes work. Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://nova-social-platform-api.onrender.com` in the Vercel environment settings for every deployment target that should use the production API. This is a public API URL, not a secret.

## Render

Use the existing Render API service; do not create a second service. The API is a Docker service with `server/` as its root directory and `Dockerfile` as its Dockerfile path. The image build runs `npm run build` to generate Prisma and compile TypeScript without needing production database access. Container startup runs `npm run db:migrate:deploy` before `npm start`, applying committed migrations without resetting application data. The server listens on `0.0.0.0` and uses Render's `PORT` when provided.

Configure the Render service environment with the required variable names listed below and in `server/.env.example`. Set `CORS_ORIGIN` to the exact HTTPS Vercel production origin(s), comma-separated if there is more than one. The API also explicitly permits the known Vercel production hostnames in `server/src/app.ts`. Store database URLs and signing keys only in Render's environment settings, never in this repository.

The Vercel frontend and Render API are cross-site, so production auth cookies must use `SameSite=None; Secure; HttpOnly`. The API defaults to `COOKIE_SAME_SITE=none` when `NODE_ENV=production`; do not override it with `lax` for this deployment. Local development continues to default to `lax`.

## PostgreSQL and Prisma

Create an empty PostgreSQL database and grant the application user only the permissions required by the application. From `server/`, run:

```sh
npm ci
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate:deploy
npm run db:migrate:status
```

`db:migrate:deploy` applies committed migrations without resetting data. The production container runs this command before starting the API. Do not use `db:push` or `migrate dev` against production.

## Build and start

Backend (set `DATABASE_URL` in the runtime environment before migrating or starting the API):

```sh
npm --prefix server ci
npm --prefix server run db:generate
npm --prefix server run db:migrate:deploy
npm --prefix server run build
npm --prefix server start
```

`npm --prefix server run build` never applies migrations. Run `npm --prefix server run db:migrate:deploy` against the intended database as a deployment/release step, then verify it with `npm --prefix server run db:migrate:status`. The production Docker container runs the deploy command on startup.

Frontend:

```sh
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com npm ci
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com npm run build
```

The included `docker-compose.production.yml` builds the API and Nginx web service. Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in the environment used by Compose and keep `server/.env` outside version control. The API health check is `GET /api/health`; the web container health check is `GET /health`.

## Domains and realtime

Point the web domain at the Nginx service and the API domain at the Express service. Set `CORS_ORIGIN` to the web origin exactly, including scheme and port where applicable. Keep HTTPS termination in front of both services. Messaging realtime currently uses authenticated Server-Sent Events at `/api/realtime`; the proxy must allow long-lived connections, forward cookies, disable response buffering for that route, and permit keep-alive connections.

Calls and live video are deliberately unavailable: the existing realtime event hub is process-local and there is no real media/signaling service or TURN configuration. The API returns HTTP 503 rather than creating calls or streams that cannot carry media; the UI disables those actions and does not claim a connection. Enabling them requires integrating a production signaling/media service (or a durable cross-instance signaling layer plus an appropriately operated WebRTC/SFU service) and TURN relay infrastructure, then validating that a peer media session was established before changing call state to connected. No provider/account is currently configured.

Registration is password-based and does not require email verification, phone verification, an OTP, or a paid provider. Users may choose a username and password and optionally add an email address or phone number; login accepts the username, email address, or phone number with that password. Passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes, and successful registration/login establish revocable, server-tracked sessions in secure HTTP-only cookies. Optional MFA can be introduced later through the existing `MfaMethod` model without making verification a prerequisite for account creation.

AI assistance endpoints also return HTTP 503 until a real AI provider is integrated. They do not return generated-looking placeholder summaries, captions, or replies.

## User media

Authenticated image uploads use `POST /api/media/uploads` with a `file` form field. JPEG, PNG, and WebP inputs up to 10 MB are decoded, orientation-corrected, resized, and re-encoded as WebP. Objects are stored persistently in PostgreSQL using the existing media-object storage; production never falls back to process memory. The returned media URL is only usable by its owner until it is attached to a profile, visible post, or active story. Story/post visibility and account blocks are checked when serving owned media. Anonymous, unattached uploads are not served; the migration backfills ownership for referenced legacy media, and deleting an owner cascades to their uploaded objects. The database migration for media ownership is deployed by the normal `prisma migrate deploy` release step.

## Payments

Payment records are provider-agnostic and remain `PENDING` until a real provider integration confirms payment. No provider credentials are included. Before enabling public checkout, configure the chosen provider's account, API key, webhook signing secret, and event endpoint in the deployment secret manager; implement signature verification, raw-body handling, replay protection, and writes to `PaymentWebhookEvent` using `(provider, providerEventId)` as the idempotency key. Never mark a payment paid from a browser request alone.

## Security checklist

- Use a unique production `JWT_SECRET`; never use example or development values.
- Use HTTPS, secure cookies, exact CORS origins, and a restricted database role.
- Run migrations before accepting traffic and confirm `/api/health` reports `database: ok`.
- Keep application logs free of passwords, tokens, payment secrets, and unnecessary personal data.
- Configure a reverse proxy timeout and buffering policy suitable for SSE.
- Rotate secrets through the deployment secret manager, not repository files.

## Verification

After deployment, verify `GET /api/health` returns HTTP 200 with `status: ok` and `database: ok`, load the web domain, register with a username/password and community rules accepted, log in with the username or optional phone/email, create a post, send a message, open the realtime stream, and confirm an admin-only endpoint rejects a normal user. Inspect logs for startup and database errors without exposing secret values.
